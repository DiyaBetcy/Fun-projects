## OCTANET_MAY

This repository is created for the Octanet internship program in web development. The goal of this repository is to showcase the work completed during the internship tasks.

### Task 1: Seven Wonders of the World Landing Page

For the first task of the internship, each intern was required to create a basic landing page. In this project, I chose to highlight the Seven Wonders of the World. The landing page provides an introduction to these iconic landmarks, presenting information and images about each wonder.

#### Features:
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Visually appealing layout with images and descriptions.
- Simple navigation and user-friendly interface.

This project is part of my learning journey during the internship at Octanet, where I am gaining practical experience in web development.

### Project Structure:
- **index.html**: Main HTML file for the landing page.
- **style.css**: CSS file for styling the landing page.

#### Features:
 ‐Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list.
 ‐Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed.
 ‐Mark Tasks as Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete to keep track of their progress.
 ‐This project continues my hands-on learning in web development as part of the Octanet internship, enhancing my skills in creating interactive and dynamic web applications.
